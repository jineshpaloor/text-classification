List of engineering branches
Engineering is the discipline, art, and profession that applies scientific theory to design, develop, and analyze technological solutions. In the contemporary era it is generally considered to consist of the major basic branches of chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. There are numerous other engineering subdisciplines and interdisciplinary subjects that are derived from concentrations, combinations, or extensions of the major engineering branches.


== Chemical Engineering ==
Chemical Engineering is the application of physical and biological sciences to the process of converting raw materials or chemicals into more useful or valuable forms.


== Civil engineering ==
Civil engineering comprises the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and natural built environments.


== Electrical engineering ==
Electrical engineering comprises the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism.


== Mechanical engineering ==
Mechanical engineering comprises the design, analysis and usage of heat and mechanical power for the operation of machines and mechanical systems.


== Systems engineering ==
Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering that focuses on how to design and manage complex engineering projects over their life cycles. Issues such as reliability, logistics, coordination of different teams (requirements management), evaluation measurements, and other disciplines become more difficult when dealing with large or complex projects. Systems engineering deals with work-processes, optimization methods, and risk management tools in such projects. It overlaps technical and human-centered disciplines such as control engineering, industrial engineering, organizational studies, and project management. Systems engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are considered, and integrated into a whole.
