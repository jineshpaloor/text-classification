On June 29, 2007, Tyco International was split and Tyco Electronics Ltd., along with Covidien, became separate, independently traded public companies. On March 10, 2011, Tyco Electronics Ltd. changed its name to TE Connectivity, which the company says it feels is more relevant to its position as a connectivity and sensor component manufacturer. On February 16, 2006, a group of institutional investors, part of an existing lawsuit against Tyco International, sued the company to stop its proposed breakup plan.
