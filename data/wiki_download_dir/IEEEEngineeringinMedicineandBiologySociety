IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society
The IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) is an IEEE group dedicated to the study of Biomedical Engineering.


== History ==
The IRE Professional Group on Medical Electronics was formed in 1952 to consider "problems in biology and medicine which might be aided in solution by use of electronic engineering principles and devices." After IRE's merge with AIEE in 1963, the Professional Group on Medical Electronics merged with AIEE's Committee on Electrical Techniques in Medicine and Biology to form the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.
