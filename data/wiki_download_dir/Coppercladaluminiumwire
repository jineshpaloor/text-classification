Copper-clad aluminium wire
Copper-clad aluminium wire, commonly abbreviated as CCAW or CCA, is an electrical conductor composed of an inner aluminium core and outer copper cladding.


== Uses ==
The primary applications of this conductor revolve around weight reduction requirements. These applications include high-quality coils, such as the voice coils in headphones, or portable loudspeakers ; high frequency coaxial applications; such as RF antennas; CATV distribution cables; and power cables.
CCA was also used in electrical wiring for buildings. The copper/aluminium construction was adopted to avoid some of the problems with aluminium wire, yet retain some of the cost advantage. In the US, solid copper is most commonly used in internal residential 120 V or 240 V wiring.
CCA became extremely popular in emerging markets as a cheap replacement for copper category 5e twisted pair cables.


== Properties ==
The properties of copper-clad aluminium wire include:
Less expensive than a pure copper wire
Lighter than pure copper
Higher electrical conductivity than pure aluminium
Higher strength than aluminium
Better solderability than aluminium, due to the lack of the oxide layer which prevents solder adhesion when soldering bare aluminium
Electrical connections are typically more reliable than pure alumimum
Typically produced as a 10% or 15% by copper volume product


== Skin effect ==
The skin effect causes alternating current to concentrate on the more-conductive copper cladding of the conductor, causing the resistance of the wire to approach that of a pure copper wire at high frequencies, which makes the copper-clad aluminium wire a good fit for such applications. The skin effect is also utilized in copper-clad steel wire such as RG-6 coax, which is also commonly used in high frequency applications with high strength requirements.
