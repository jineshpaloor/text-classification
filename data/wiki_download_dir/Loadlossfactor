Load-loss factor
Load-loss factor (LLF) is a factor which when multiplied by energy lost at time of peak and the number of load periods will give overall average energy lost.
It is calculated as the ratio of the average load loss to the peak load loss.
For electricity utilities, expect about 0.3.
In the days when computers were uncommon, estimates were derived from the Load Factor using an empirical formula.
