IEEE Industrial Electronics Society
The IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (IES) is a Society of the IEEE.


== Vision Statement ==
The Industrial Electronics Society through its members encompasses a diverse range of technical activities devoted to the application of electronics and electrical sciences for the enhancement of industrial and manufacturing processes. These technical activities address the latest developments in intelligent and computer control systems, robotics, factory communications and automation, flexible manufacturing, data acquisition and signal processing, vision systems, and power electronics. The Society continually updates its program of technical activities to meet the needs of modern industry.
The vision of the IES is to advance global prosperity by fostering technological innovation, enabling members' careers and promoting community worldwide. The IES promotes the engineering process of creating, developing, integrating, sharing, and applying knowledge about electro- and information technologies and sciences for the benefit of humanity and the profession.

== History of the society ==
February 21, 1951 - First meeting of the IRE Industrial Electronics Group
May 8, 1951 - Name change to IRE Professional Group on Industrial Electronics (PG-IE)
August 1953 - Published the first volume of the Transactions on Professional Group on Industrial Electronics
August 21, 1963 - IRE merged with AIEE and become IEEE. The PG-IE approved the merger of IRE's PG-IE and AIEE's group on control instrumentation (GCI)
August 22, 1963 - The merger of the PG-IE and the GCI into Professional Group on Industrial Electronics and Control Instrumentation (PG-IECI) was approved by the IEEE Executive Committee
October 14, 1964 - Name change to Group on Industrial Electronics and Control Instrumentation (PG-IECI)
Year 1975 - First IECON was held in Philadelphia. Until then there had been only a sponsored session at the Industry Applications Society Conference
March 20, 1978 - Name change to Industrial Electronics and Control Instrumentation Society (IECIS)
June, 1982 - Name change to Industrial Electronics Society
