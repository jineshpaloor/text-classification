== Technical Communities ==
The Communication Society's technical committees define and implement the technical directions of the Society. As a fundamental element of the Society all members are invited - and encouraged - to participate in one or more of its technical committees. These committees - networks of professionals with common interests in communications - usually meet twice a year at major conferences. Throughout the year, these committees also play a major role in determining which events (conferences, workshops, etc.) are technically co-sponsored by ComSoc.
