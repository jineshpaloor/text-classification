IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society
The IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society (IEEE SMC) is a professional society of the IEEE.


== History ==
The earliest incarnation of the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society was the IRE Professional Group on Human Factors in Electronics, formed in 1958. The Group would later change its name to IEEE Professional Technical Group on Human Factors in Electronics (1963), IEEE Human Factors in Electronics Group (1964), Man-Machine Systems Group (1968), Systems, Man and Cybernetics Group (1970), and finally Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society (1972).


== Field of interest ==
As stated on its website, the society's main focuss is related to:
systems engineering and the development of its technology including "problem definition methods, modeling, and simulation, methods of system experimentation, human factors engineering, data and methods, systems design techniques and test and evaluation methods".
the integration of "theories of communications, control, cybernetics, stochastics, optimization, and system structure towards the formulation of a general theory of systems", and
the application of these theories at "hardware and software levels to the analysis and design of biological, ecological, socio-economic, social service, computer information, and operational man-machine systems".


== Publications ==
The IEEE SMC Society publishes three peer-reviewed journals called "IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics", Part A, Part B, and Part C. Part A is devoted to systems and humans, and Part B to cybernetics.


== Conferences ==
The society sponsors a range of annual conferences around the world that focuses on its Field of Interest.
