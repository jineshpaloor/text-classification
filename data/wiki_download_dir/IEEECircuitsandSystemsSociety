IEEE Circuits and Systems Society
The IEEE Circuits and Systems Society is a society of the IEEE. It is also known by the acronym IEEE CASS. In the hierarchy of IEEE, the Circuits and Systems Society is one of close to 40 technical societies organized under the IEEE's Technical Activities Board.
From the IEEE CAS web site, the field of interest of the society is defined to be
"The theory, analysis, design (computer aided design), and practical implementation of circuits, and the application of circuit theoretic techniques to systems and to signal processing. The coverage of this field includes the spectrum of activities from, and including, basic scientific theory to industrial applications."


== History ==
The first meeting of the IRE Professional Group on Circuit Theory was on March 20 of 1951. After the IRE and the AIEE merged, the IRE Professional Group on Circuit Theory became the IEEE Professional Technical Group on Circuit Theory on March 25 of 1963. In 1966 the group changed its name to the Group on Circuit Theory, and in 1973 became the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society.


== Activities ==
The Society organizes many conferences every year and operates local chapters around the world. It coordinates the operation of several councils, task forces, and technical committees.


=== Publications ===
The Circuits and Systems Society oversees the publication of eleven periodical magazines and scholarly journals:
IEEE Transactions on Circuits & Systems I: Regular Papers
IEEE Transactions on Circuits & Systems II: Express Briefs
