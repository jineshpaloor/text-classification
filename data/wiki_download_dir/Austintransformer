Austin transformer
An Austin transformer is a special type of an Isolation transformer used for feeding the air-traffic obstacle lamps and other devices on a mast radiator antenna insulated from ground. As the electrical potential difference between the antenna and ground is high (up to 300 kV), feeding the lamps directly is impossible. The transformer consists of two ring-like windings with a large air space between the winding and the magnetic core. The large spacing provides both isolation from high voltage and low inter-winding coupling capacitance. 
The Austin transformer is named after its inventor, Arthur O. Austin, who graduated from Stanford University in 1903 and who obtained 225 patents in his career.
