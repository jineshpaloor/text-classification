John L. Moll
John Louis Moll (December 21, 1921 – July 19, 2011) was an American electrical engineer, notable for his contributions to solid-state physics.


== Biography ==
Moll was born in Wauseon, Ohio, and obtained a B.Sc. in Physics and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Ohio State University in 1943 and 1952 respectively. The Ebers-Moll transistor model, and the theory of the p-n-p-n switch, came from this effort.
Moll was the recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1964; Howard N. Potts Medal, Franklin Institute, 1967, and received the IEEE Edison Medal in 1991 "for pioneering contributions to diffused and oxide-masked silicon devices, transistor analysis, the p-n-p-n switch, and optoelectronics."
He was a Fellow of the IEEE and a member of the American Physical Society, the National Academy of Engineering, and the National Academy of Sciences.
