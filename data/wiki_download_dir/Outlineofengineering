=== Aerospace engineering ===
Aerospace engineering is the branch of engineering behind the design, construction and science of aircraft and spacecraft. It is broken into two major and overlapping branches: aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering. The former deals with craft that stay within Earth's atmosphere, and the latter deals with craft that operates outside of Earth's atmosphere.


=== Applied engineering ===
Applied engineering is the application of management, design, and technical skills for the design and integration of systems, the execution of new product designs, the improvement of manufacturing processes, and the management and direction of physical and/or technical functions of a firm or organization.

=== Planetary engineering / Climate engineering (Geoengineering) ===
Planetary engineering is the application of technology for the purpose of influencing the global properties of a planet. The goal of this theoretical task is usually to make other worlds habitable for life. Perhaps the best-known type of planetary engineering is terraforming, by which a planet's surface conditions are altered to be more like those of Earth. Other types of planetary engineering include ecopoiesis, the introduction of an ecology to a lifeless environment. Planetary engineering is largely the realm of science fiction at present, although some types of climate change on Earth are recent evidence that humans can cause change on a global scale.


=== Software engineering ===
Computer-aided engineering
Cryptographic engineering
Information engineering
Knowledge engineering
Language engineering

=== Systems engineering ===
Systems Engineering covers analysis, design, and control of engineering systems. It focuses on the science and technology of industrial systems. It emphasizes the analysis and design of systems to produce goods and services efficiently. Two unique features set systems engineering apart from other engineering disciplines: (1) the particular attention devoted to both the physical processes involved and to the decision making components of the industrial environment, and (2) the wide scope applicability of its systems methodology, not limited to manufacturing industries, but effectively used in all kinds of business organizations.


=== Textile engineering ===
The Textile Engineering Program is accredited by ABET, Inc. Textile engineering courses deal with the application of scientific and engineering principles to the design and control of all aspects of fiber, textile, and apparel processes, products, and machinery. These include natural and man-made materials, interaction of materials with machines, safety and health, energy conservation, and waste and pollution control. Additionally, students are given experience in plant design and layout, machine and wet process design and improvement, and designing and creating textile products. Throughout the Textile Engineering curriculum, students take classes from other engineering and disciplines including: Mechanical, Chemical, Materials and Industrial Engineering Departments.
