Nanoinverter
A nanoinverter, also referred as nano inverter or solar nano inverter, converts direct current (DC) from a single solar cell or small solar panel to alternating current (AC). Nanoinverters contrast with Microinverter devices, which are connected to larger than 100 Watt solar panels.
Nanoinverters have several advantages over Microinverter. The main advantage is that, even small amounts of shading, debris or snow lines in any one solar cell, or a smaller panel failure, does not disproportionately reduce the output of an entire larger panel. Each nanoinverter obtains optimum power by performing maximum power point tracking for its connected panel.


== Description ==


=== Building Integrated Photo Voltaics ===
BIPV modules produce direct current power from range 10 watts to 100 watts. Integrated circuit-based AC nanoinverter on each module increases harvest rate by 30% and substantially decreases the installation constraints.


=== Solar Cell ===
DC nanoconverter-on-chip is capable to harvest from microwatts power and as low as 80mV (0.08V) voltage. Harvest rate improves 30%-70% with integrated MPPT and DC-DC booster
