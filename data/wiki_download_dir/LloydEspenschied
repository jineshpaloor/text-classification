He was an avid genealogist of the Espenschied/Esbenshade/Espenshade family, visiting Germany for the purpose of extensive research. He discovered that all bearers of this name can trace roots back to a common ancestor, Thomas Espenschied, who was born during the turbulent period of the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), and who lived with his wife Judith (née Lotz) in Kriegsfeld. One son remained in Kiegsfeld. Three sons settled in Siefersheim, which became the starting point for the main branches of the family. Today many families named Espenschied live in Siefersheim.
Lloyd Espenschied died on June 1, 1986, at a nursing home in Holmdel, New Jersey.
