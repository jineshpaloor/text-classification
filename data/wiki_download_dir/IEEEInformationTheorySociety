IEEE Information Theory Society
The IEEE Information Theory Society (ITS), formerly the IEEE Information Theory Group, is a professional society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) focused on several aspects of information: its processing, transmission, storage, and usage; and the "foundations of the communication process".


== History ==
The foundation of the society was made in 1951 when the IRE Professional Group on Information Theory came together for the first time. This professional group was part of the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE). With the merge of the IRE into the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 1963, the name was changed into IEEE Professional Technical Group on Information Theory, but one year later simplyfied into IEEE Information Theory Group. The final name IEEE Information Theory Society was taken in 1989.


== Publications ==
IEEE ITS publishes the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory and the IEEE ITS Newsletter.


== Conferences ==
IEEE ITS sponsors widely-attended conferences and workshops internationally each year.


== Awards ==
Claude E. Shannon Award
