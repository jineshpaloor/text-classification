IEEE Dielectrics & Electrical Insulation Society
The IEEE Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation Society (DEIS) is a professional society of the IEEE.


== History ==
The Professional Technical Group on Electrical Insulation held their first meeting on September 16, 1963, and changed their name shortly after to the Group on Electrical Insulation in May 1964. In 1978 the group's name was changed to Electrical Insulation Society and in 1986 became the Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation Society.


== Field of Interest ==
The society's Field of Interest "includes the study and application of dielectrics from the molecular level, through nano-structured materials, to insulation systems in industrial, commercial, and power system equipment, to emerging applications such as those at high power levels and in biological and other small-scale systems. DEIS supports the entire scope of this field from advancing the basic science, to enhancing the ability of practicing engineers to use emerging dielectric materials, to the development of standards for the prudent application of existing and new insulation systems".


== Publications ==
IEEE DEIS produces two major publications  that deal with its Field of Interest: Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation and Electrical Insulation Magazine.


== Conferences ==
IEEE DEIS sponsors several internationally recognized conferences that focus on its Field of Interest.
