Electrochemical engineering
Electrochemical engineering is the branch of engineering dealing with the technological applications of electrochemical phenomena (such as synthesis of chemicals, electrowinning and refining of metals, batteries and fuel cells, sensors, surface modification by electrodeposition and etching, separations, and corrosion). It is an overlap between electrical engineering and chemical engineering. One of the pioneers of this field of engineering was Charles Frederick Burgess.


== History ==
This branch of engineering emerged gradually from chemical engineering. The works of Wagner (1962) and Levich (1962) influenced the emergence of electrochemical engineering, because their work inspired so many others. Several individuals, including Tobias, Ibl, and Hine, established engineering training centers and, with their colleagues, developed important experimental and theoretical methods of study.
