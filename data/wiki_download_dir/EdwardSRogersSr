Edward S. Rogers, Sr.
Edward Samuel "Ted" Rogers (June 21, 1900 – May 6, 1939) was a Canadian pioneer in the radio industry and the founder of the Rogers Vacuum Tube Company and CFRB radio station. He is regarded as the founder of Rogers Communications, although it was established in 1967, almost three decades after his death.


== Early life ==
Rogers was born on June 21, 1900, in Toronto, Ontario. His parents were Albert Stephen Rogers (1860-1932) and Mary Ella Elsworth (1862-1946). He had an older brother named Joseph Elsworth Rogers (1898-1960).
Rogers' father was a director with Imperial Oil Company and formerly a partner in Samuel and Elias Rogers Coal Company (Elias Rogers and Company), founded in 1876 by his Quaker father, Samuel Rogers, and his uncle, Elias Rogers (d. 1920). Elias Rogers served as a Toronto alderman for St. Lawrence Ward in 1887. The family descends from Timothy Rogers (Quaker leader), the founder of Newmarket, Ontario and Pickering, Ontario.


== Career ==
Rogers first became interested in radio when he saw a receiver at age 11. By 1913, he was noted in local newspapers for his skill at operating a radio station, which at the time was an impressive technical accomplishment. Rogers worked as a radio officer on Great Lakes passenger ships during the summers of 1916-1919 inclusive. In 1921, Rogers operated the only Canadian (and only spark-gap) station to successfully compete in the first amateur trans-Atlantic radio competition. Rogers held the amateur radio call sign 3BP, and joined the Canadian chapter of the American Radio Relay League in 1921.
In the early 1920s, radio transmitters and receivers ran on large and expensive batteries to provide the high voltages needed for the vacuum tubes used. Early attempts at producing a radio receiver to operate on household alternating current were unsuccessful, since tubes designed for the low current supply from batteries were unsatisfactory when operated on 25- or 60-hertz alternating current. The batteries were also extremely large and bulky.
In April 1924, Rogers travelled to the United States and saw experimental AC receiving tubes at the laboratories of Westinghouse in Pittsburgh. He purchased the patent rights to the experimental alternating current tubes of Frederick S. McCullough. After further development, Rogers produced a design of vacuum tube that would operate on alternating current.
By 1925, Rogers had introduced not only a complete radio receiver using the new tubes, but had also produced a "battery eliminator" (power supply) that could be used with other manufacturers' receivers to eliminate the expensive batteries. By August 1925, the Rogers Batteryless radio was in commercial sales, the first radio receiver in the world to operate from household current. At a time when a schoolteacher might earn $1,000 per year, the top-of-the-line Rogers radio sold for $370. Rogers formed the company "Standard Radio Manufacturing" (later Rogers Vacuum Tube Company) to produce radio receivers using the new design of vacuum tubes.
In 1927, Rogers founded CFRB (Canada’s First Rogers Batteryless) radio station. The station is owned today by Bell Media.
In 1930, he married Velma Melissa Taylor. Three years later, they had a son, Edward S. Rogers Jr., who grew up to build Rogers Communications into a media conglomerate.


== Death ==

Rogers died suddenly in 1939 due to complications of a hemorrhage, and was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, Toronto. His brother, Joseph Elsworth Rogers, served as Vice-President and later President of Rogers Majestic. He ran the business until his death in 1960, when Edward S. Rogers Jr. took control of the business.


== Relatives ==
Members of Rogers' family included:
Alfred Stephen Rogers (1860-1932): Rogers' father; partner in coal business with Elias Rogers, and oil company director.
Elias Rogers (d. 1920): Rogers' uncle; partner in coal business with A.S. Rogers.
Alfred Rogers (m. Winifrede Warwick and d.1953): Rogers' cousin; son of Elias Rogers, who later inherited the coal business from his father.
