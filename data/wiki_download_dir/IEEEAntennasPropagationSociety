IEEE Antennas & Propagation Society
The IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society (AP-S) is a society of the IEEE.


== History ==
Before the merger of AIEE and IRE in 1963, the predecessor of the IEEE Antennas & Propagation Society (AP-S) was the IRE Professional Group on Antennas and Propagation (PGAP), formed in 1949.


== Field of Interest ==
The society’s field of interest is defined on its homepage as “antennas, including analysis, design, development, measurement, and testing; radiation, radio propagation, and the interaction of electromagnetic waves with discrete and continuous media; and applications and systems pertinent to antennas, propagation, and sensing, such as applied optics, millimeter- and sub-millimeter-wave techniques, antenna signal processing and control, radio astronomy, and propagation and radiation aspects of terrestrial and space-based communication, including wireless, mobile, satellite, and telecommunications".


== Publications ==
The IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society publishes three notable academic publications, including:
IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation
IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters 
IEEE Antennas & Propagation Magazine


== Conferences ==
AP-S sponsors a number of conferences around the world that focus on its field of interest.
The 2012 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation and USNC/URSI National Radio Science Meeting will be held 8–13 July 2012 in Chicago, IL
The 2011 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation and USNC/URSI National Radio Science Meeting was held 3–9 July 2011 in Spokane, WA, USA
The 2010 IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation and USNC/URSI National Radio Science Meeting was held July 11–14, 2010 in Toronto, Canada.
