IEEE Electron Devices Society
The IEEE Electron Devices Society is a professional society of the IEEE.


== History ==
The IEEE Electron Devices Society was initially formed as the IRE Electron Tubes and Solid-State Devices Committee in 1951, and quickly became a professional group: in March 1952 it was called the IRE Professional Group on Electron Devices. After IRE's merger with AIEE in 1963, the group became the IEEE Professional Technical Group on Electron Devices, which merged with the Solid State Devices Committee in 1963, and with the New Energy Sources Committee in 1964, becoming the IEEE Electron Devices Group. In 1976 the group changed its name to the IEEE Electron Devices Society.


== Field of Interest ==
In its constitution, IEEE EDS states that its Field of Interest is "all aspects of engineering, physics, theory, experiment and simulation of electron and ion devices involving insulators, metals, organic materials, plasmas, semiconductors, quantum-effect materials, vacuum, and emerging materials. Specific applications of these devices include bioelectronics, biomedical, computation, communications, displays, electro and micro mechanics, imaging, micro actuators, optical, photovoltaics, power, sensors and signal processing.
The Society is concerned with research, development, design and manufacture related to materials, processing, technology, and applications of such devices, and scientific, technical, educational and other activities that contribute to the advancement of this field".
