Norman Abramson
Norman Manuel Abramson (April 1, 1932) is an American Jewish engineer and computer scientist, most known for developing the ALOHAnet system for wireless computer communication.
Born in Boston, Massachusetts, he received an A.B. in physics from Harvard University (1953), an M.A. in Physics from UCLA (1955), and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford University (1958).
He worked as a research engineer in the Hughes Aircraft Company until 1955, when he joined the faculty at Stanford University (1955–65), was visiting professor at University of California at Berkeley (1966), before moving to University of Hawaii (1968–94), serving as professor of both Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and Director of Aloha Systems. He is currently the Vice President of Aloha Networks, established in San Francisco (1994).
His early research concerned radar signal characteristics and sampling theory, as well as frequency modulation and digital communication channels, error correcting codes, pattern recognition and machine learning and computing for seismic analysis. In the late 1960s he worked on the ALOHAnet and continued to develop spread spectrum techniques in the 1980s.
