IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society
The IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society (ITSS) is a professional society of the IEEE.


== Field of Interest ==
The IEEE ITS Society's field of interest is in "theoretical, experimental and operational aspects of electrical and electronics engineering and information technologies as applied to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), defined as those systems utilizing synergistic technologies and systems engineering concepts to develop and improve transportation systems of all kinds."


== Publications ==
The IEEE ITS Society publishes a journal, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems. In 2009, it launched a new magazine called the ITS Magazine.
The ITS Society also publishes a quarterly newsletter, available on its website and via email.


== Conferences ==
The IEEE ITS Society sponsors a number of annual international conferences.
Started in 1998, the ITS Society's flagship conference series, the IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conferences (ITSC) target basic research and applications of leading advances in communications, computer, control, and electronics technologies related to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).
The Intelligent Vehicles (IV) Symposium, an annual forum sponsored by the IEEE ITS Society, gathers researchers from industry and universities to discuss research and applications for Intelligent Vehicles and Intelligent Infrastructures. IV papers deal with all aspects of vehicle-related intelligent systems and cooperation between vehicles and infrastructures.
The ITS Society also sponsors the following annual conference series: the IEEE International Conference on Service Operations, Logistics and Informatics (SOLI), covering innovative research related to services/logistics design, innovations, marketing, operations, and informatics; the IEEE International Conference on Mechatronic and Embedded Systems and Applications (MESA), focusing on mechatronic (integration between the components/hardware and the information-driven functions/software) and embedded systems; and the IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI), studying the development and use of advanced information technologies for local, national/international, and global security related applications through an integrated technological, organizational, behavioral, and policy-based approach.
