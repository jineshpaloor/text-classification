Remote racking system
A remote racking system is a system that allows an operator to operate a racking system from a remote location. It offers a safe alternative to manually racking circuit breakers, which reduces the requirement for service personnel to wear a full-body arc flash hazard suit for protection.


== §Advantages ==
A circuit breaker is an automatically operated electrical switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by overload or short circuit.
An arc flash is a type of electrical explosion that results from a low impedance connection to ground or another voltage phase in an electrical system. By permitting the automatic racking of the circuit breaker from a remote location, the remote racking systems move service personnel outside the arc flash protection boundary, thus reducing the need for a full-body arc flash hazard suit.
A remote switch operator is used to remotely operate various types and styles of circuit breakers and controls. When the remote racking system is used in conjunction with a remote switch operator, the user can also operate, trip, and release the circuit breaker from a safe distance.


== §Designs ==
There are several designs of remote racking systems on the market and most include either a wired or wireless remote control. The distance at which these can be used varies by which product is chosen. Also the style and size will also be a factor in choosing a remote racking system as some are larger than others.
