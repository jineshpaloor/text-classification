IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society
The IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society is a professional society of the IEEE. The society's Field of Interest, according to its website, include metrology, analog and digital electronic instruments, systems and standards for measuring and recording electrical quantities (in both the frequency and time domains), instrumentation and transducers for measurement of non-electrical variables, calibration and uncertainty, instruments with automated control and analysis functions, safety instrumentation, and new technology applications.


== History ==
The IRE Professional Group on Instrumentation was established on March 9 of 1950, which after the merger with AIEE in 1963 changed its name to the IEEE Professional Technical Group on Instrumentation and Measurement. In 1964 the group changed its name to the IEEE Group on Instrumentation and Measurement and again in 1978 to the IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society.


== Publications ==
The IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society publishes the I&M Magazine and the IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement (TIM).


== Conferences ==
The society sponsors three major conferences  on a yearly basis.
International Instrumentation and Measurement Conference
Sensors Applications Symposium
AUTOTESTCON
In addition, there are a number of smaller, area-specific conferences sponsored by I&M, including but not limited to the following:
International Symposium on Haptic Audio-Visual Environments and Games
International Symposium on Robotic and Sensors Environments
International Symposium on Medical Environments and Applications
International Workshop on Applied Measurements for Power Systems
International Conference on Imaging Systems and Techniques
