RF connector
A coaxial RF connector (radio frequency connector) is an electrical connector designed to work at radio frequencies in the multi-megahertz range. RF connectors are typically used with coaxial cables and are designed to maintain the shielding that the coaxial design offers. Better models also minimize the change in transmission line impedance at the connection. Mechanically, they provide a fastening mechanism (thread, bayonet, braces, blind mate) and springs for a low ohmic electric contact while sparing the gold surface, thus allowing very high mating cycles and reducing the insertion force. Research activity in the area of radio-frequency (RF) circuit design has surged in the 2000s in direct response to the enormous market demand for inexpensive, high-data-rate wireless transceivers.

List of coaxial connectors
The following audio and video connectors are sometimes used for RF, but are not generally considered to be RF connectors:
DIN connector (not to be confused with "7/16 DIN" or "DIN 1.0/2.3" connectors)
RCA connector (Radio Corporation of America) originally introduced for audio, but now widely used for video as well
SCART
Concentric twinax connector
