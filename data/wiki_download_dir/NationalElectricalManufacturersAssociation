National Electrical Manufacturers Association
The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) is the association of electrical equipment and medical imaging manufacturers in the United States. It was founded in 1926 and maintains its headquarters in Rosslyn, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. Its approximately 450 member companies manufacture products used in the generation, transmission, distribution, control, and end use of electricity. These products are used in utility, industrial, commercial, institutional, and residential applications. The associationâ€™s Medical Imaging & Technology Alliance (MITA) division represents manufacturers of cutting-edge medical diagnostic imaging equipment including MRI, CT, x-ray, and ultrasound products. Global sales of NEMA-scoped products exceed $140 billion. NEMA also has offices in Beijing and Mexico City.
In addition to lobbying activities, NEMA publishes more than 600 standards, application guides, white papers, and technical papers.
